//Directed graph: If it is visited && it is in the recursion 'stack' (if parent it will be, so no need to check alag se)
//recursion 'stack' is a hashmap from node to whether it is in the current path or not

//Do DFS for finding cycle in a graph. Keep path for backtracking
//If a node is not visited, do hasCycle on it. it returns true, return true. Else look at next neighbour
// If visited, look if it s in recursion stack

    //essentially this:
    //If it hasn't been visited, visit it
    //else, check if it is in the path covered till now (using a 'array', or more generically, a hashmap data structure called 'recursion stack' for keeping track)
    //ADVANTAGE OF ARRAY OVER CHANGING THE COLOR OF NODE: If the graph is used for multiple searches or is being searched concurrently,
    //one array oer search is better
    //SO, equivalent to undirect, except, also keep an extra hashmap to track of the current path
