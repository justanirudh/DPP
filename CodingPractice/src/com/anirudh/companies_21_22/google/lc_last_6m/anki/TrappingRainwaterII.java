Given an m x n integer matrix heightMap representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, return the
volume of water it can trap after raining.



Example 1:


Input: heightMap = [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks.
We have two small ponds 1 and 3 units trapped.
The total volume of water trapped is 4.
Example 2:


Input: heightMap = [[3,3,3,3,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,2,1,2,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,3,3,3,3]]
Output: 10

/*
For each row and each col, create 2 arrays: left and right
then for each cell, find min (leftmax, rightmax, top-max, bottom-max) - height_cell
 */
public class TrappingRainwaterII {
  public int trapRainWater(int[][] heightMap) {
   return 0;
  }
}
