# Daily Practice Problems

These include coding problems that I used to prepare for the numerous interviews I have given. Many are them are selected from LeetCode premium based on how frequently the company asked them, difficulty, etc.


Some of the companies it has questions for include Facebook, Google, Two Sigma, TradeDesk and so on. . . 

Just solving these might get you in a good position to interview for the company.
